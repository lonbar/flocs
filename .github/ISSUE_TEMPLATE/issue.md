**Before reporting a bug (remove before posting)**

Keep in mind that these containers are not officially associated with the software included. It is worth considering the following:

1. FLoCs tries to, but does not necessarily run the latest versions of everything. Make sure that the bug is reproduced with the most up-to-date supported version(s) of the package.

2. Bugs in individual software packages are likely better suited on their respective issue trackers.
